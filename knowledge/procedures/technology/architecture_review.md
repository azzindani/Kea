# Procedure: Architecture Review

Framework for the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of software system designs.

### Steps
1. **Documentation**: Map the current architecture, service boundaries, and data flow patterns.
2. **Bottleneck Identification**: Identify potential scalability bottlenecks and single points of failure.
3. **Security Audit**: Assess the overall security posture and zero-trust alignment.
4. **Debt Evaluation**: Quantify technical debt and its impact on the development velocity.
5. **Benchmarking**: Compare the design against industry best practices (e.g., Twelve-Factor App, WELL-architected framework).
6. **Roadmapping**: Recommend a prioritized improvement path for remediation.
