# Strategic Planning Procedure

This procedure defines the "Thought-before-Action" phase of any major research project or enterprise operation.

## 1. Objective Deconstruction
*   **The Intent**: Identify the fundamental goal (e.g., "Market Entry Strategy" or "Vulnerability Audit").
*   **Success Metrics**: Define exactly what "Done" looks like (The Definition of Done).
*   **Constraint Audit**: Assess time, compute budget, and legal boundaries.

## 2. Topological Blueprinting (DAG Design)
*   **Parallelization**: Identify which tasks can run concurrently (e.g., Searching Industry Trends + Financial Audits).
*   **Dependency Mapping**: Determine which nodes require the output of previous nodes (e.g., Synthesis depends on Fact-Finding).
*   **Sub-Graph Spawning**: Identify complex sub-problems that require their own dedicated Orchestrator instance.

## 3. Persona Matching
*   **The Right Tool for the Job**: Assign specific Expert Personas (Skills) to each node of the DAG.
*   **Hierarchy Assignment**: Determine which nodes require "Senior Analyst" autonomy vs. "Intern" execution.

## 4. Risk & Confidence Calibration
*   **Vulnerability Scan**: Identify which parts of the plan are most likely to fail due to data scarcity or LLM bias.
*   **Fallback Paths**: Design a "Plan B" (e.g., "If Source A is blocked, pivot to Source B").

## 5. Review & Approval
*   **The Red Team**: Mentally simulate the plan's execution. Will it actually solve the CEO's problem?
*   **Approval**: Proceed to the Orchestrator for JIT compilation and execution.
