# Procedure: Trend Analysis

Structured process for identifying, evaluating, and projecting patterns over time.

### Steps
1. **Data Harvesting**: Collect historical data points spanning at least 5 years (where available).
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring cycles, inflection points, and structural shifts.
3. **Driver Identification**: Uncover the underlying economic or technological forces driving the observed trends.
4. **Sustainability Audit**: Evaluate the long-term sustainability and velocity of the current trend.
5. **Projection Mapping**: Project future trajectories using confidence ranges (Base/Bull/Bear).
6. **Disruption Identification**: Identify potential "black swan" events or disruptions that could break the trend.
