# Procedure: Research Methodology

The standard foundation for performing reliable, multi-source investigation within the Project ecosystem.

### Steps
1. **Question Refinement**: Convert the user's initial prompt into a precise research question.
2. **Source Selection**: Identify 3-5 authoritative primary and secondary data sources.
3. **Multi-Perspective Collection**: Actively seek out data from multiple, potentially conflicting perspectives.
4. **Fact Triangulation**: Cross-reference key findings between different sources to confirm reliability.
5. **Gap Assessment**: Explicitly identify what data is missing or remained uncollected.
6. **Synthesis**: Combine findings into a coherent and structured narrative.
7. **Calibration**: Assign a confidence level (High, Medium, Low) to each major claim.
