2. **Growth Mapping**: Identify primary growth drivers, structural headwinds, and cyclical factors.
3. **Concentration Audit**: Analyze market concentration using indices like the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI).
4. **Value Chain Mapping**: Map the industry value chain and identify where the "profit pools" are concentrated.
