# Procedure: Company Valuation

Comprehensive methodology for establishing the intrinsic or market value of a business.

### Steps
1. **Methodology Selection**: Determine the most appropriate valuation framework (DCF, Public Comps, or Precedent Transactions) based on asset type and data availability.
2. **DCF Modeling (if applicable)**:
   - Project Free Cash Flows (5-10 years)
   - Determine appropriate WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)
   - Calculate Terminal Value using perpetuity growth or exit multiple
3. **Comparable Analysis (if applicable)**: Identify a relevant peer group and calculate trading multiples (e.g., P/E, EV/Rev).
4. **Triangulation**: Compare results across multiple methods to find a reasonable valuation range.
5. **Adjustment**: Apply appropriate discounts (e.g., Lack of Marketability) or premiums (e.g., Control Premium) where necessary.
6. **Reporting**: Provide a valuation range rather than a single point estimate to account for modeling sensitivity.
