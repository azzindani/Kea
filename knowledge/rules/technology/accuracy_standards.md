# Rule: Tech Accuracy Standards

Guidelines for maintaining high-fidelity technical research.

- **Source Specificity**: Performance claims must cite specific, reproducible benchmarks where available.
- **Methodology Clause**: Market share or adoption data must include the methodology used and the date of the study.
- **Version Integrity**: All technology comparisons must be version-specific (e.g., Comparing 'Node.js 18' vs 'Bun 1.0').
- **Full Cost Accounting**: Cost estimates must include all hidden components (compute, tiered storage, data egress, network).
