# Rule: Source Priority

Preferred sources for obtaining reliable technical information.

1. **Primary Documentation**: Official technical specifications and vendor documentation are the gold standard.
2. **Academic Research**: Peer-reviewed papers for deep research topics and core algorithms.
3. **Developer Ecosystem**: Surveys from reputable sources (Stack Overflow, JetBrains, State of JS) for adoption data.
4. **Open Source Health**: GitHub metrics (stars, commit frequency, issue resolution) for project sustainability.
5. **Market Insight**: Analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester) for market sizing and enterprise trends.
