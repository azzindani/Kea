# Rule: Confidence Calibration

Standardized scoring criteria for determining the reliability of synthesized claims.

- **High (0.9+)**: Requires multiple independent, authoritative sources agreeing on the same data point.
- **Medium (0.7-0.9)**: Supported by at least 2 credible sources with no significant contradictions.
- **Low (0.5-0.7)**: Based on a single credible source; acceptable but must be caveated.
- **Uncertain (< 0.5)**: Insufficient or conflicting data; must be explicitly flagged as uncertain.
