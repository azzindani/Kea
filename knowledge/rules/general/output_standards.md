# Rule: Output Standards

Universal quality requirements for every document or report generated by the system.

- **Ubiquitous Citation**: Every factual claim, number, or quote must cite its specific source.
- **Quantitative Preference**: Favor specific numbers and ranges over vague terms like "large," "many," or "fast-growing."
- **Conflict Transparency**: Conflicting data between sources must be acknowledged and presented, never hidden.
- **Explicit Gap Disclosure**: Any information gaps identified in the research plan must be clearly stated in the final summary.
