# Rule: Source Quality

Hierarchy of information reliability for general research.

1. **Highest Quality**: Official government data, national statistics, and peer-reviewed academic papers.
2. **Moderate Quality**: Major news organizations, established industry journals (verify across multiple).
3. **Sentiment Only**: Social media, community forums, and personal blogs (treat as opinions, not facts).
- **Recency**: Always prioritize and note the recency of the data used in the synthesis.
- **Primary Source Mandate**: Actively prefer primary source documents over secondary analysis or summaries.
