# Rule: Financial Accuracy Standards

Strict requirements for the validation and presentation of financial data.

- **Filing Alignment**: All financial figures must exactly match official regulatory filings (SEC, IDX, etc.).
- **Temporal Context**: Market capitalization and stock price data must always be accompanied by a specific "as-of" date and time.
- **Period Specification**: Any mention of growth rates (YoY, QoQ, CAGR) must explicitly specify the time period covered.
- **Source Attribution**: Forward-looking estimates must clearly distinguish between analyst consensus and proprietary model outputs.
