# Kea Cognitive Architecture

Kea follows a fractal, tiered hierarchy of consciousness. Each "Human Kernel" instance operates as a specialized employee within the broader Corporate Kernel.

## 1. The Multi-Tier Fractal Model
Intelligence is organized into distinct tiers of consciousness and orchestration:
*   **Tier 0-5 (Base Kernel)**: Standardized primitives including the Vault, Planner, and Core processing.
*   **Tier 6 (Metacognition)**: Monitors like the Hallucination Monitor, Noise Gate, and Cognitive Load Monitor.
*   **Tier 7 (Conscious Observer)**: The apex of the Human Kernel. It integrates all lower tiers into a coherent cognitive pipeline (Gate-In -> Execute -> Gate-Out).
*   **Tier 8+ (Corporate Kernel)**: Governs the swarm, manages hierarchies, and routes tasks to specialized Human Kernels.

## 2. The Cognitive Cycle (OODA)
The Human Kernel runs a standard recursive processing unit called the **Cognitive Cycle** (or OODA Loop):
1.  **Perceive**: Ingest raw input and classify intent.
2.  **Frame**: Align the task with the agent's identity and loaded knowledge.
3.  **Plan**: Decompose the goal into executable steps (DAG).
4.  **Execute**: Execute tools and collect artifacts.
5.  **Monitor**: Verify progress and grounding.
6.  **Package**: Synthesize the final outcome and update state.

## 3. The Conscious Observer (Tier 7)
The **Conscious Observer** is the entry point for agent identity. It manages:
*   **Gate-In Phase**: Perception, classification, and activation routing.
*   **Execute Phase**: The core cognitive loop with real-time Cognitive Load monitoring.
*   **Gate-Out Phase**: Hallucination checks, confidence calibration, and the final Noise Gate.

## 4. Hierarchy Personas
*   **CEO**: Ultimate visionary and goal-setter.
*   **Principal Solutions Architect**: System designer focused on multi-step orchestration.
*   **Senior Research Analyst**: Independent optimizer focused on pattern recognition.
*   **Junior Research Associate**: High-execution persona focused on reliable data collection.
