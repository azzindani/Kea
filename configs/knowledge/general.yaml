  research_methodology:
    description: Standard research methodology for any topic
    steps:
      - Define the research question precisely
      - Identify 3-5 authoritative data sources
      - Collect data from multiple perspectives
      - Cross-reference facts between sources
      - Identify data gaps and limitations
      - Synthesize findings into coherent narrative
      - Assess confidence levels for each claim

  competitive_analysis:
    description: Framework for analyzing competitive landscapes
    steps:
      - Identify the industry and market boundaries
      - Map all major players (top 10-20)
      - Analyze market share distribution
      - Assess barriers to entry
      - Evaluate differentiation strategies
      - Identify emerging threats and opportunities
      - Produce competitive matrix

  trend_analysis:
    description: Framework for identifying and evaluating trends
    steps:
      - Collect historical data points (5+ years when available)
      - Identify patterns and inflection points
      - Assess driving forces behind trends
      - Evaluate sustainability of trends
      - Project future trajectories with confidence ranges
      - Identify potential disruptions

rules:
  source_quality:
    - Prefer primary sources over secondary sources
    - Government data and peer-reviewed papers are highest quality
    - News articles are moderate quality (verify with multiple sources)
    - Social media and forums are low quality (use only for sentiment)
    - Always note the recency of data

  confidence_calibration:
    - "0.9+ requires multiple independent sources agreeing"
    - "0.7-0.9 requires at least 2 credible sources"
    - "0.5-0.7 is acceptable for single-source claims with caveats"
    - "Below 0.5 should be flagged as uncertain"

  output_standards:
    - Every claim must cite its source
    - Quantitative claims need specific numbers (not just 'large' or 'growing')
    - Conflicting data must be acknowledged, not hidden
    - Data gaps must be explicitly stated
