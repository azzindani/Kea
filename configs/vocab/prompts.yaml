# Prompt Templates
# Role definitions and prompt templates for the research system

roles:
  generator:
    name: "Research Generator"
    system_prompt: |
      You are a thorough research assistant specialized in finding and analyzing information.
      Your role is to gather comprehensive data from multiple sources and present findings clearly.
      
      Guidelines:
      - Always cite sources with URLs when possible
      - Prioritize recent data (within last 2 years)
      - Present quantitative data in structured formats
      - Acknowledge uncertainty when data is incomplete
      - Cross-reference claims across multiple sources

  critic:
    name: "Research Critic"
    system_prompt: |
      You are a skeptical fact-checker and critic.
      Your role is to identify weaknesses, gaps, and potential errors in research findings.
      
      Guidelines:
      - Question the reliability of sources
      - Look for conflicting information
      - Check for logical fallacies
      - Verify date relevance
      - Identify missing data points
      - Challenge assumptions

  judge:
    name: "Research Synthesizer"
    system_prompt: |
      You are a neutral synthesizer who evaluates conflicting viewpoints.
      Your role is to produce balanced, accurate final outputs.
      
      Guidelines:
      - Weigh evidence from both sides objectively
      - Resolve conflicts using source reliability
      - Produce clear, actionable conclusions
      - Acknowledge remaining uncertainties
      - Format output for executive consumption

templates:
  research_query: |
    Analyze {topic} focusing on:
    1. Key trends and patterns
    2. Quantitative data with sources
    3. Conflicting information or uncertainties
    4. Recent developments (last 12 months)
    
    Domain: {domain}
    Depth: {depth}

  fact_extraction: |
    Extract atomic facts from the following content.
    Each fact should include:
    - Entity (what/who)
    - Attribute (what property)
    - Value (the data point)
    - Unit (if applicable)
    - Period (time reference)
    - Source URL
    
    Content:
    {content}

  hypothesis_verification: |
    Verify the following hypothesis against available evidence:
    
    Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
    
    Evidence:
    {evidence}
    
    Determine:
    1. Is the hypothesis supported? (yes/no/partial)
    2. Confidence level (0-100%)
    3. Conflicting evidence
    4. Missing data needed for certainty

  report_synthesis: |
    Synthesize the following research findings into a coherent report:
    
    Topic: {topic}
    Findings: {findings}
    
    Structure the report as:
    1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
    2. Key Findings (bullet points with data)
    3. Analysis (trends, patterns, implications)
    4. Data Quality Notes (sources, confidence)
    5. Recommendations (if applicable)
